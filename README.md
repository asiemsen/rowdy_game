This RowdyHacks, our team and I wanted to try and make a 2D side scrolling platformer in the same vain as games like Celeste and Super Meat Boy, but with a twist of our own. 
The games's gimmick is being able to pick up items on the stages and use them as platforms, making the game a unique and creative platforming experience. We wanted the player to feel like they could make thier
own stages while playing the game. 

With limited experience in Godot, we knew this would be a challenge, however, we now have a fully functional stage and basic controls for the character. The work is far from over, but the foundation of a 
great side scrolling platformer is certainly there.
